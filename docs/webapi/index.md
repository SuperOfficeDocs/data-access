# WebAPI

The HTTP WebAPI comes in 2 parts:

* [REST Web API][1] - URLs describe entities like person or sale
* [Agents Web API][2] - the services API accessible via HTTP

The **REST** API is not as complete as the **Agents** API, but it should cover the most common use cases, and be easier to use and navigate.
