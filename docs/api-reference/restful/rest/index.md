# SuperOffice REST API v1

Welcome to the SuperOffice WebAPI.

SuperOffice REST Web API exposes objects as entities that can be manipulated using the HTTP verbs GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.

You can get the version number and build-date from the API endpoint `/api`.

If you fetch the version URL, you get back a list of supported URLs: `/api/v1`.
