The HTTP WebAPI comes in two parts:

* **REST WebAPI** - URLs describe entities like person or sale: [Learn][1] | [Reference][3]
* **Agents WebAPI** - the services API accessible via HTTP: [Learn][2] | [Reference][4]

The **REST** API is not as complete as the **Agents** API, but it should cover the most common use cases, and be easier to use and navigate.
