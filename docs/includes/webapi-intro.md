The HTTP WebAPI comes in two parts:

* **REST WebAPI** - URLs describe entities like person or sale: [Learn][1] | [Reference][3]
* **Agents WebAPI** - the services API accessible via HTTP: [Learn][2] | [Reference][4]

While the Agents WebAPI is the most complete of the two, the REST WebAPI covers the most common use cases and is easier to use and navigate.
