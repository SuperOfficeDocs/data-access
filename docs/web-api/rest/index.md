# REST WebAPI

Exposes objects as entities that can be retrieved using HTTP GET, modified using HTTP PUT, created using HTTP POST, and deleted using HTTP DELETE.

**Examples:**

`GET /api/v1/Contact/123`

Returns a JSON object representing Contact 123. This object can be PUT to update it or DELETEd - subject to the usual [sentry restrictions][10]. Attempting to GET an object that doesn't exist will return an HTTP 404 error.
â€‹
`POST api/v1/List/Category/Items`

Adds a new list item to the Category list.

## Entities

The REST API has the major entities (Company, Person, Project, Sale, etc) exposed.

* `/api/v1/Contact`
* `/api/v1/Person`
* `/api/v1/Project`
* `/api/v1/Sale`
* ...

The entities all have similar structures

`/api/v1/Contact` Returns an ODATA feed of contact records. You can select fields, order, filter the result using ODATA operations.

`/api/v1/Contact?$select=name,category&$filter=registeredDate before '2009-1-1'`

This returns the contact ID, name, and category for contacts created before 2009.

`/api/v1/Contact/default` returns a new blank entity.

`/api/v1/Contact/123` returns the Contact with ID 123. This object can be PUT or DELETE - subject to the usual sentry restrictions. If your role does not allow you to update, then the web API won't give you more access.

`/api/v1/Contact/123/Simple` returns a simplified version of the entity. This cannot be updated or deleted, but it can be easier to work with - it does not have deeply nested structures, and does not support things like user-defined fields.

Most of the entities have user-defined fields, and expose information about the layout at `/api/v1/Contact/UdefLayout`.

The actual user-defined field values are returned in the entity's `UserDefinedFields` property. Many have related lists of other entities as well:

* `/api/v1/Contact/123/Projects`|
* `/api/v1/Contact/123/Sales`|

These lists are archives that you can filter and sort using OData operations.

## Lists

SuperOffice has built-in lists (Category, Business, Position, etc). You can add your own custom lists.

`/api/v1/List` returns a list of lists.

To return meta-data about the list, including the list ID:

* `/api/v1/List/Category`
* `/api/v1/List/Business`
* `/api/v1/List/YourOwnList`

To return the list items in the given list:

* `/api/v1/List/Category/Items`
* `/api/v1/List/Business/Items`
* `/api/v1/List/YourOwnList/Items`

`/api/v1/MDOList` gives you read access to hierarchical lists and other list providers in the system.

## Archives etc

**Archives:**

The archive provider system is exposed as an OData endpoint.

* `/api/v1/Archive/OwnerContacts?$select=contactId,name,orgnr`
* `/api/v1/Archive/EmailAddress?$select=fullName,emailAddress&$filter=contactId=12`

**User preferences:**

User preferences and `pref.descriptions` can be read and updated.

* `/api/v1/Preference/section/keyname`
* `/api/v1/PreferenceDescription/section/keyname`

**Foreign keys:**

`/api/v1/ForeignApp/Glops/Foobar/Key/Lookup/Contact/123`

Returns the key called 'Lookup' from the foreign app 'Glops' for the Contact record 123.

**Strings:**

Built-in string resources can be read in supported languages.

`/api/v1/String/SR_YES?isoLangCode=sv`

## System

Users, Roles, License stuff is exposed via simple endpoints. If you have admin rights in your role, you can POST or PUT to update system information.

* `/api/v1/User/Tony`
* `/api/v1/Role/12`
* `/api/v1/License/SuperOffice`

## Errors

Errors are returned using HTTP error codes, and as a JSON object:

`/api/v1/Contact/99999` returns HTTP **404 Contact Not Found**, and the following JSON result

```json
{
  "Error": true,
  "ErrorType": "SoNotFoundException",
  "ErrorMessage": "Contact id 99999 not found",
  "ErrorSource": "SuperOffice.Services.Implementation"
}
```
