# Search for contacts with a given SAINT value

In this example, we will retrieve all the contacts whose SAINT values are set to active.

## Code

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/search-saint-archiveagent.cs)]

## Walk-through

Here we are retrieving all contacts with `saintstatus1` set to true.

**Saintstatus1** refers to the first record in the `StatusDef` table. `Saintstatus2` refers to the second record and so on.

In the test database, `StatusDef` with ID 1 is called *Neglected Customer*. These names of the `StatusDef` can be found in the `LocaleTest` table.

Here, `Istrue` implies that the `issignalled` field in the `statusvalue` table. `Issignalled` field says whether the saint value is active or not.

**Output:**

```text
