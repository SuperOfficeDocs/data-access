# SAINT values

Values are much easier than [counters][1]. They are simple binary values - either on or off.

To find all the SAINT values for a particular contact or project, simply search the `StatusValue` table:

```SQL
Select * from statusvalue where contact_id =89
```

![x][img1]

The image that is shown on the contact card is determined by the status definition - and the blob linked to this record.

```SQL
Select * from statusdef where statusdef_id = 7
```

![x][img2]

`isVisual` indicates that a picture is used to mark that the status is active.

The actual picture is found viaÂ the blob link table.
