# Carrier

A **carrier** is an object that will carry the data between the [Agent][1] and the NetServer services.

There are 2 kinds of carriers: simple read-only carriers and complex entity carriers. Complex entity carriers can be updated and sent back for saving to the database, while simple read-only carriers cannot be saved back to the database.

* [Read-only carriers][2]
* [Entity carriers][3]
