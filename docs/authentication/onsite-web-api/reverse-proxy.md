# Reverse proxy

If your installation is protected from the internet by a reverse proxy, then the URLs generated by the WebAPI will be wrong (since the API does not know about the proxy).

In the *web.config* file you can specify the hostname to use instead of the internal server's name:

```xml
<SuperOffice>
  <Client>
    <add key="UrlSchemeOverride" value="https" />
    <add key="UrlPortOverride" value="443" />
    <add key="UrlHostOverride" value="crm.example.com"/>
  </Client>
</SuperOffice>
```

This will replace the hostname used in the links generated by the webAPI with the overrides, so that clients will see links that match the hostname that they see (the hostname of the proxy), rather than the internal hostname.

> [!NOTE]
> The path portion is not mapped or changed.
