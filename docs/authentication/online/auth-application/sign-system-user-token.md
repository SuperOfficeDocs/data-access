# How to sign system user token

Before requesting a new system user ticket, you have to sign your system user token with your RSA private key. The timestamp is also updated.

TheÂ **SignedSystemToken** element has the following format:

* plain text [system user token][1]
* a period (.)
* a UTC date time formatted as YYYYMMddhhmm using leading zeros
* a period (.)
* a Base64-encoded, signed version of the first 3 items

For example:

```javascript
System User Token.YYYYMMDDHHMM.mwhpYcNBfFqEaL0uLkCwXB99sM/Wo7DOnhjRwsmwNAd2EmBM1z+Co=
```

## Pre-requisites

* Your application is approved and authenticated.
* You have [validated the claim][2] and extracted the system user token from the `SuperIdToken`.
* You have your private key file ([converted from RSA to PEM][4]).

## To sign the token

1. Concatenate the first 3 items: `PLAINTEXT_TOKEN.TIMESTAMP`.

2. Using the partner's private certificate key, sign the concatenated items.

3. Base64 encode the signed result.

### [Signing with JavaScript](#tab/sign-js)

```javascript
const utcTimestamp = moment.utc().format('YYYYMMDDHHmm');
const data = `YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN.${utcTimestamp}`;

let sign = crypto.createSign('SHA256');
sign.update(data);
sign.end();

sign = sign.sign(rsaPrivateKey, 'base64');
const signedToken = `${data}.${sign}`;
```

### [Signing with PHP](#tab/sign-php)

```php
$systemUserTokenAndTime = Application Name-pzqc70604i.201511111342
$signature = signVariable($systemUserTokenAndTime)
$signedSystemToken = $systemUserTokenAndTime + "." + base64_encode($signature)
```
